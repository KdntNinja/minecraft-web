# Util

Utility and helper functions for the game.

- General-purpose math, string, and slice utilities
- Used by multiple subsystems (engine, gameplay, rendering)
- No dependencies on game-specific logic

## Example Utilities

- Clamp, Lerp, and interpolation helpers
- Random number helpers
- Data structure helpers (e.g., 2D slices)

## Notes

- Keep utility functions generic and reusable
- Avoid introducing dependencies on core game logic
